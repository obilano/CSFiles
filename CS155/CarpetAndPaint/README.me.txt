Allow a user to enter information about a bunch of rooms that are being considered for upgrades. After each room is entered, the user will be asked to enter "Y" or "N" if there are any more rooms to be entered. Continue looping until the user says "N".

For each room, the user will enter the name of the room (Bathroom, Garage, Living Room, etc.), the length, width, and heightof the room (all dimensions in feet). 

The program should call two functions: (1) Compute how much carpet would be needed for that room, and (2) Compute how much paint would be needed for that room.

Do some research so that your numbers are realistic and proper dimensions are used.

You do not need to have the user input the cost of paint or carpet. You can declare those as constants in your program and just assume the cost will be the same for every room. Your program will probably need other constants as well.

You do not need to worry about doors or windows when computing paint cost. Just assume the rooms have no doors or windows to simplify your calculations.

For each room, the results of those two functions, along with the data input (room name, length, width, height), should be displayed to the screen.

When the program completes, the program should display the total carpet cost, the total paint cost, and the grand total of carpeting and painting all of the rooms.
