Write a program that will generate some 3-digit lottery numbers. More specifically, your program should:

* Ask the user how many lottery numbers to generate. Validate so that the input is between 1 and 366.

* Generate that many numbers in the range [0..999] and store them to an array

* Send the numbers to a data file named "lottery.txt". Display them so that 3 digits will be displayed for each number.

* For example, if you ran your program and said you wanted 7 lottery numbers, the file might end up looking something like this:

492

733

043

661

829

003

481
