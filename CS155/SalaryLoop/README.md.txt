Write a program that calculates how much a person would earn over a period of time if his or her salary is one penny the first day and two pennies the second day, and continues to double each day. The program should ask the user for the number of days. Display a table showing how much the salary was for each day. The output should be displayed in a dollar amount (i.e., $0.16), not the number of pennies.
