Write a function that accepts 3 value parameters that are exam scores and returns the maximum and minimum exam scores as reference parameters.

Create a program that will validate input data so exam scores are in the range [0..100] and it allows the user to do as many trials as she wishes. Each time 3 exam scores are entered, the program should display the maximum and minimum.

The programs should then ask the user if she would like to continue by entering a "Y" or "N". If so, the user will enter another 3 exam scores.
