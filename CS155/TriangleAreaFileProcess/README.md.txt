Write a function called get_sides that will ask the user to enter 3 sides of a triangle and return those as reference parameters. The function should validate so that each side is greater than zero.

Write another function that will accept 3 sides of a triangle as value parameters and compute and return the triangle's area. Use the formula discussed in class to perform the computation.

Write a main program that will allow the user to enter as many triangles as he wishes. The user should be prompted after each triangle to see if he would like to continue.

In addition to sending output to the screen, save the triangle sides and area to a data file named "triangles.txt".
