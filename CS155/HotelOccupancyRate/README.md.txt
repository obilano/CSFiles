Write a program that calculates the occupancy rate for a residence hall. The program should start by asking the user how many floors does the residence hall have. Data validation should continue asking this question until the user has entered a valid number (1 or higher). 
A loop should then iterate through each floor. In each iteration, the user will be asked how many rooms on each floor and how many of them are occupied. For the number of rooms on each floor, data validation should continue asking this question until the user has entered a valid number (10 or higher). 
Once the iterations are complete, your program should display the total number of rooms, the total number that are occupied, and the percentage of occupied rooms (as a percent rounded to one decimal place).
