Write a program that includes the following functions:

* FillInOrder - puts values into array 10, 20, 30, ....

* FillReverseOrder - puts values into array 5000, 4995, 4990, ...

* FillRandomOrder - puts random values into array between 1000 and 10000 (inclusive)

* DisplayArray - prints values to screen, 5 per line, in a nice tabular format

 * ALL 4 functions will have void as return type and have two parameters - the array and the size of the array

The main program should be called in order to demonstrate that each function is working correctly. Ask the user at the beginning how many numbers she would like. Validate so that between 1 and 200 numbers are chosen.

Once the user has entered the count, your program should provide a menu with the 4 options above along with a quit option. The program should loop until quit is entered.
