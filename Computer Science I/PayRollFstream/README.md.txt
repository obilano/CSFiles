Modify Assignment #8 so that the input will come from a data file named "pay-in-XXXX.txt" (where XXXX is your last name). The format will have an employee name on one line and the hours and rate on the second line. For example (no blank lines in input file):

Mickey Mouse
20.5 13.50
Donald Duck
5 12.75

In addition to sending the output to the screen, the program will send the output to a a data file named "pay-out-XXXX.txt" (where XXXX is your last name). For each employee, the data file should contain their name, hourly rate, number of hours, as well as the pay information (regular, double, triple, total) that was computed before.
