Write a program that will keep track of the car inventory at some regional auto stores.

Your program should begin by reading the inventory from a data file named "inventory.txt". 
The first line of the file  will  contain  the  number  of  stores.  
You  may  assume  that  there  will  not  be  more  than  100  stores.  
The remaining  lines  will  have  the  number  of  cars  at  store  #1,  store  #2,  etc.  
A  data  file  might  look  something  like this:5223314947After reading the file, 
your program should provide a menu-based system in which the user will have 4 options:
1 – Display the inventory of all stores
2 – Add some cars to a store
3 – Remove some cars from a store
4 – Quit the program

If the user chooses something besides 1 through 4, an "Invalid choice" message should be displayed.
When the user chooses options #2 or #3, the program should first ask for the store number (with data validation) and then ask for the quantity. 
The removal of cars should validate data.
If you run your program, the sample interaction might look something like that shown below (continuing on to the reverse side of this sheet). 
Feel free to modify the look and feel, as well as the wording, to make your program user-friendly.
