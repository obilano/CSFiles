PROBLEM: Ask the user to enter her name, as well as the principal, annual interest rate, number of compoundings per year, and the number of years of an investment. Using the formulas discussed in class, your program should compute the future value and the total interest earned. Those values should be displayed using two decimal places. The user's name should be displayed, too.

1) Write an algorithm to solve the problem. 
2) Write a flowchart to model the solution to the problem. 
3) Implement the solution to your problem as a C++ program.
