Write a program to compute the amount of federal tax that is owed for a given year. The program should ask the user for the total amount of taxable income and if the user will be filing as a single (s) or married (m). 

The amount of tax owed can be computed by the following:

Status: Single
Taxable income is at most $32,000, the tax is 10% of the income
Taxable income is over $32,000, the tax is $3,200 + 25% of the amount over $32,000

Status: Married
Taxable income is at most $64,000, the tax is 10% of the income
Taxable income is over $64,000, the tax is $6,400 + 25% of the amount over $64,000
