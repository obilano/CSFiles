In physics, an object that is in motion is said to have kinetic energy. The following formula can be used to determine a moving object’s kinetic energy:

     K = ½ m v2

The variables in the formula are as follows: K is the kinetic energy, m is the object’s mass in kilograms, and v is the object’s velocity, in meters per second.

 Write a C++ function named kineticEnergy that accepts an object’s mass (in kilograms) and velocity (in meters per second) as arguments. The function should return the amount of kinetic energy that the object has. Write a complete C++ program below that will demonstrate the function by calling it after asking the user to enter values for mass and velocity from the keyboard. Assume that the user may enter values with decimal places. The function definition should be placed after the function main().
