PROBLEM: In a game of chess, you can estimate the strength of a current game by adding up the "weights" of the pieces on the board. One weighting system is:

10-Queen, 5-Rooks, 3-Knights, 3-Bishops, 1-Pawns

Write a program to ask the user how many of each type of piece is on the board. Compute and display the total value of the pieces.

For example, if the user had 1 rook, 2 bishops, and 5 pawns on the board, the total value would be 16 (1*5 + 2*3 + 5*1).


1) Write an algorithm to solve the problem. 
2) Write a flowchart to model the solution to the problem.
3) Implement the solution to your problem as a C++ program.
