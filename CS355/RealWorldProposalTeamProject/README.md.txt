Detail a description of your real world scenario that you will use on the front end of your Real World Shortest Path Algorithm.

This document will contain the following components:

1: The initial idea description (give a big picture of your plan to demonstrate)
2:  A list of functional requirements
3: A list of non-functional requirements
4: A mock-up of the user interface (Front end)
5:  A description of all data structures that will be used (Back end)
6:  Description(s) of the input and/or output  file formats
7:  Detailed, Predicted Team Schedule
8:  Test plan, differentiated by front end and each data structure/algorithm used

 
Create a project that will demonstrate the shortest path problem. 
Your project will be composed of a front end application that makes use of a back end. 
Your back end will solve the shortest path algorithm on a directed acyclic graph.
