write a C program that acts as a shell (or command interpreter).  
This program should be able to take command lines from the user and execute them.  
This includes command arguments and file redirection.  
Below is a list of instructions your shell should be able to correctly handle.  
They are ordered roughly from least to most complicated to handle, 
so as you evolve your shell I recommend you deal with each in turn from top to bottom.  
(If you are unfamiliar with any of these standard commands, there are plenty of resources available to you online.

ls
cat myfile
ls -l
ls -al
gcc -o myprog prog.c
cat myfile > otherfile
