Write a C program which inputs needed data, calls the algorithm of your paper, and prints out results.    
Your program should have a statement of purpose with a clear description of the input expect and the output given.  
If your program requires reading from a file, give at least three input files with the expected output which should result.  
This should appear within comments:  input filename:output  
If your program could get user input from the keyboard, 
be sure to give 3 example input/output pairs in your documentation.
