You will pick a real-world object.  Be a little creative.  For example, create a class for a taco, or for a tank, or for a wallet.  Write a class to represent your new data type. 

Basic requirements:

0- appropriate data member(s)

1- at least two constructors

2- accessor method(s)

3- mutator method(s)

4- input method

5- display method

6- one additional method that takes an object as a parameter

7- a drive to test the class.
