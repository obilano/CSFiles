Write a program that will store information for up to 10 football teams.  You will store information about the scores made in each quarter or each team.  To store this, you will need 5 parallel arrays (1 for the team name and 1 for each of the 4 quarters).  You will write a the following functions:

main: this is the driver where the arrays will be created and all functions will be called.  Be sure there is a good flow for the user.

FillArrays:  fill the arrays from a file.

PrintArrays: print each team, one team per row, the scores from each quarter for the respective teams and the total score.  The total score should be calculated in the program.

GetMax:  this function should be able to take in any integer array (scores for a given quarter) and return the team name of the highest score in that list.  The driver will determine which array is passed in.

You have the freedom to add other functions, such as a menu, to make your program flow better.
